======

Demo app to show how to use geojson (http://www.geojson.org/) in a web application. The server side is developed with web2py (http://www.web2py.com/) and it relies on postgres/postgis, the frontend uses leaflet (http://leafletjs.com/) to draw the map.

To understand how simple are these things, see these two files:
- Backend: https://github.com/ilvalle/w2pgis/blob/master/controllers/default.py
- Frontend: https://github.com/ilvalle/w2pgis/blob/master/views/default/index.html
